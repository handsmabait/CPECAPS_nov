\section{Leg Landmark Detection Results}

The implementation of the leg tracking system successfully demonstrates the capability to detect and track key anatomical landmarks on the lower extremities. Figure \ref{fig:leg_landmark} illustrates the detected landmarks overlaid on the leg region, showing the system's ability to identify critical points such as the hip, knee, and ankle joints.

    \label{fig:leg_landmark}
\end{figure}

The landmark detection forms the foundation for subsequent gait analysis, as these keypoints enable the calculation of joint angles, stride length, and other biomechanical parameters essential for assessing walking patterns.

\section{Training Dataset}

The training dataset comprises video frames captured from various walking scenarios to ensure robust model performance across different conditions. Figures \ref{fig:train_sample_1} through \ref{fig:train_sample_3} present representative samples from the training dataset, demonstrating the diversity of poses, lighting conditions, and perspectives included in the model training process.

% Show in this chapter proofs why your proposed solution works.  However, presenting results ("It worked") without an appropriate explanation does not show thorough understanding.  Aside from the data and results that you have obtained, and their explanation, the discussion includes why components of your proposed solution worked or did not work in accordance to what you described in the evaluation process, and how the proposed solution performed and fared. Interpret the results and the reasons why they were obtained.  If your results are incorrect, apparent discrepancies from theory should be pointed out and explained. In essence, what do the results mean?  Citing existing publication can help you compare your results and your explanations.
