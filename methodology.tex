\subsection{Methodology Overview}
This project develops a desktop real-time pose-estimation application for Tinikling learning. The pipeline comprises (1) dataset collection and annotation, (2) real-time landmark detection using MediaPipe with OpenCV preprocessing, (3) model robustness improvements via augmentation and fine-tuning, (4) a per-segment scoring and feedback engine, and (5) system evaluation and user studies for performance and usability.

\subsection{Dataset Collection and Annotation}
We collect Tinikling performances using consumer webcams across varied environments (lighting, backgrounds, participant clothing). Each recording is annotated with segment boundaries and ground-truth reference trajectories for the core Tinikling steps. Annotation files follow a simple CSV schema: frame index, timestamp, keypoint coordinates (x,y[,z if available]), and segment label.

\subsubsection{Real-time Pipeline (Implementation)}
\label{sec:implement}
The real-time pipeline components:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Capture \& Preprocessing:} Acquire frames from webcam at target frame rates; apply resizing, color normalization, and optional background subtraction using OpenCV.
    \item \textbf{Landmark Detection:} Run MediaPipe Pose to extract 2D/3D keypoints; post-process landmarks (smoothing, confidence thresholding).
    \item \textbf{Segmentation \& Alignment:} Detect segment boundaries (simple heuristics or learned segment classifier), then align performed segment to reference via DTW or constrained alignment.
    \item \textbf{Scoring \& Feedback:} Compute per-joint and per-segment metrics; convert distances to 0--100 scores, present instant cues (visual/audio) and detailed breakdowns in UI.
    \item \textbf{Logging \& Persistence:} Save session logs, computed metrics, and anonymized recordings for later analysis.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Model Robustness and Training}
To improve robustness:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Augment datasets with photometric (brightness/contrast), geometric (rotation, scale), and synthetic occlusion transforms.
    \item Perform k-fold validation and ablation studies to measure the effect of augmentations.
    \item Where appropriate, fine-tune a lightweight backbone (e.g., MediaPipe-compatible network) or add a small temporal refinement network (multi-frame fusion) for increased temporal stability.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scoring, Calibration, and UX}
Scoring converts aligned distances into interpretable percentages per segment:
\[
\text{score} = 100 \times \max\!\left(0, 1 - \frac{\text{normalized\_error}}{\text{threshold}}\right)
\]
Calibration includes per-user baseline capture (neutral stance and sample steps) to normalize per-joint tolerances. UI design emphasizes low-latency cues for learning (immediate feedback) and a post-run breakdown for correction.

\subsection{Evaluation Plan}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Automated metrics:} Detection accuracy (\%), MPJPE where available, processing fps, latency (ms).
    \item \textbf{User study:} $n\geq 10$ participants performing a standardized Tinikling routine; questionnaires to measure perceived accuracy, ease-of-use, and satisfaction. Target: $\geq 80\%$ positive feedback.
    \item \textbf{Robustness tests:} Evaluate under varied lighting, occlusion, and viewpoint conditions; measure drop in accuracy and suggest mitigations.
    \item \textbf{Report:} Compile results, run statistical tests where applicable, and provide actionable recommendations.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Deliverables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Desktop application with installer and README (architecture, usage, install).
    \item Annotated dataset subset and reference choreography library.
    \item Evaluation report including metrics, user-study results, and recommendations.
    \item Source code release and simple reproducibility instructions.
\end{itemize}
